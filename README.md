# tetris-dqn

This is still a work in progress.

I tried to train an AI to play Tetris using deep Q-learning. It uses CNNs on the board state and on a few other statistics like column heights and hole depth, though the models I've trained haven't been very successful - they seem to stack tall towers and leave holes everywhere. I might come back to this later when I'm a little better at ML.
